# Instructions for Running
standard gitignore for node.js, meaning that if you want to run this on your machine you'll have to first install the node packages (using npm install). You still won't be able to get the data from database because of CORS, meaning that you can uncomment the cors line for localhost and comment out the line directly above. This should allow you to retrieve data from my database without needing the environment variables.
